# National Museum

The National Museum of Ukraine landing page is a responsive website designed using HTML, SASS, and the BEM methodology. It features a structured navigation menu with links to "Gallery," "Exhibitions and Events," "About Us," and "Contacts."
The layout begins with a header containing a prominent "Tickets" button and a large main image, followed by a schedule section displaying the museum's hours and upcoming activities. Below, the current events section showcases a list of actual events with images, dates, names, and brief descriptions.
Further down, the lecture section provides details about upcoming lectures, and the gallery section offers a curated collection of images. The footer includes a subscription form for email updates, social media links, a repeat of the navigation menu, the schedule, and contact details.
This page offers a clean and informative design, ensuring ease of navigation and accessibility.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the game board, buttons, and messages. It defines the basic layout of the game grid and elements like the score display, win/loss messages, and the start/restart button.
- **SCSS**: Used for styling the game’s UI, giving it a visually appealing look. SCSS offers more flexibility than standard CSS, allowing the use of variables, nesting, and mixins to maintain a clean and manageable stylesheet. It controls the appearance of grid cells, colors, animations, and dynamic class changes based on the game’s state (e.g., changing styles as tiles merge).
